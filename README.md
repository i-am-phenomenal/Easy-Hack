# Easy-Hack

This project was made so that i can control my laptop through my phone for some basic commands for instance shut down my laptop from my phone, launch a youtube video and so on. 
Run the project using python manage.py runserver
Make sure to run the ngrok.exe to expose your local port to internet.
In the ngrok prompt, type ngrok http 8000. It will generate 2 urls one for http and other for https. Open the http url in your phone and see the project work like a charm.

Will add more functionalities once i think of something.
